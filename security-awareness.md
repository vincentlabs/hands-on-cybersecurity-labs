# Security Awareness

## What is Security Awareness?
Security awareness is about knowing how to recognize and avoid cyber threats. Most attacks don’t happen because of some advanced hack. They happen because someone clicked a bad link, reused a weak password, or shared information they shouldn’t have.

According to IBM, human error is behind 95% of successful cyberattacks.

## Who Is It For?
Everyone. Whether you’re in IT, HR, finance, or any other department. If you have access to company systems or data, you’re a target.

- HR handles employee records  
- Finance has access to banking and credit card info  
- Regular users manage email, documents, and internal systems  

If you’re connected, you’re involved in security—whether you realize it or not.

## Why It Matters
Remote work, personal devices, and email-based threats have made it easier for attackers to exploit simple mistakes. The consequences are serious:

- Average cost of a data breach: $3.86 million  
- Legal action, fines, and compliance violations  
- Loss of customer trust and brand damage  

Being aware of basic security principles helps reduce these risks.
