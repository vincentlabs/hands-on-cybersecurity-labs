# Security Awareness

## What is Security Awareness?
Security awareness is about knowing how to recognize and avoid cyber threats. Most attacks don’t happen because of some advanced hack. They happen because someone clicked a bad link, reused a weak password, or shared information they shouldn’t have.

> According to IBM, human error is behind 95% of successful cyberattacks.
